    <p>I believe that children born between 2000 and 2005 have unique and valuable childhood experiences. </p>
    <p>From watching favorite animations on CDs to watching whatever you want on iPad.</p>
    <p>From squatting in front of the TV at fixed times and waiting for cartoons to be broadcast on "Haha Children" (a previous popular cartoon channel), to ask parents to join memberships of video software such as "iQiyi" and "Tencent Video".</p>
    <p>We have seen a lot of software emerge and then be replaced by newer software.</p>
    <p>In childhood, everyone must have hidden under the quilt and secretly read their favorite novels, but despised the textbooks.</p>
    <p>With the advent of Japanese comic culture, everyone must have watched a few Japanese comics and learned a few Japanese words during childhood.</p>
    <p>I hope this website can bring back happy childhood memories for my peers. </p>
