    <h1 class="title">Lamb</h1>
    <h3 class="aurthor">Richie Hofmann</h3>
    <p class="Poem">I had a lamb I brought everywhere
        <br>
        who only had one eye.
        <br>
        At the train stations,
        <br>
        all the grown-ups would say, be <span id="adj1" class="changecolor">mindful</span>
        <br>
        of your things, <span id="adj2" class="changecolor">little</span> boy,
        <br>
        someone will steal right out of your pocket
        <br>
        or take the watch off your wrist.
        <br>
        My dad had a <span id="adj3" class="changecolor">beautiful</span> overcoat.
        <br>
        The lamb’s white fur got smudged.
        <br>
        My brother was a baby,
        <br>
        and in the restaurants,
        <br>
        the old waiters would pick him up
        <br>
        and kiss him again and again on the cheek
        <br>
        with their mustaches
        <br>
        and tell my parents
        <br>
        that they promised they would bring him back in a minute
        <br>
        but now they needed to show the chef.
        <br>
        I don’t remember when the eye became unglued
        <br>
        and who knows where it went.
        <br>
        On long train rides,
        <br>
        I remember falling asleep,
        <br>
        putting my finger in the hole where it used to be.
        <br>
        Once he had to go in an overhead bin,
        <br>
        and he was <span id="adj4" class="changecolor">freezing</span> when I kissed him again.</p>
